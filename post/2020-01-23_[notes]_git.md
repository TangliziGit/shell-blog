# Notes for git

Learning git via practises.


## Case 1

错误的在master上编写了代码, 需要将其转移到dev上:
```bash
stash
checkout dev
stash pop
stash list      # check stash stack
```


## Case 2

修改前n次的提交信息
1. `rebase -i HEAD~3`
2. edit the rebase file, overwrite the `pick` using `edit`:
```
0   | pick 6e10567 stage
  1 | pick a35e6ed stage
  2 | edit 317eaf8 merge
  3 |
  4 | # Rebase 186dee6..317eaf8 onto 186dee6 (3 command(s))
  5 | #
  6 | # Commands:
  7 | # p, pick = use commit
  8 | # r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
  9 | # e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
 10 | # s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
 11 | # f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
 12 | # x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
 13 | # d, drop = remove commit
 14 | #
 15 | # These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
 16 | #
 17 | # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
 18 | #
 19 | # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
 20 | #
 21 | # Note that empty commits are commented out

```
3. Now you are just after the commit `317eaf8`.  
You can edit your commit, till you want commit it.  
Maybe you want to change some code or change the commit time.  
```
vim README.md
git add .
git commit --amend -m "use rebase"      # if not, there will be a conflict.
git rebase --contiue
```
4. then your branch will be:
```
